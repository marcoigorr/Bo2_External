## How to use
Simply run _"ExternalTrainer_Bo2.exe"_ when the game is running. 

You can either start the cheese when the game is running or when you are in a zombie match.

In case you have opened the program before starting the zombie match, you will not see the correct values in the INFO section of the console, so update the addresses with F10 (or close and then reopen the cheese).
